# CollegeBound

This project was created for my SFSU class CSC 690.

Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WylyCTC2p73yJG81L9Nm2Qf5Er5EEVCbeMLwyK_OA6s/edit?usp=sharing) to read my project proposal. A prototype for the project can be found linked in the proposal.

I am a single person team. CollegeBound is an XCode project for students to buy and sell university equipment such as texbooks. This is the basics of the app and more features will hopefully be added at a later date.
